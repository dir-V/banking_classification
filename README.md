# banking_classification
This Jupyter Notebook explores the Bank Marketing dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing), using Python Data Science libraries such as Scikit learn, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.
The goal of the notebook was to create classification models trained on the data that are capable predicting whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a 'term deposit' with the bank.
The features that are most important for this prediction are conlcuded at the end.
